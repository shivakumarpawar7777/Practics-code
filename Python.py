#Feature of Python
1. easy to learn & use.
2. high level programming language. print("Hello world")
3. Interpreted language. (reads the codes line by line)
4. Dynamiclly type language 
5. And object oriented language (oops)

#  Histiry:-  Python  foundation by guido van rossum in 1980s & published on fabrury 1991.

# Appliction of python

4. CAD (computer aided designs)
5. Artificial intelligence & mechine learning
6. Enterprise application
7. Software development etc.

# Advantages of pyton
>>> Simple ane easy to learn
>>> Readability 
>>> langer community support 
>>> extensive of libraies

#Disadvatages of python
>>> slow speed
>>> Runtime errors
>>> Poor memory efficiency or consumption
>>> weak in mobile computing 
>>> Database access

# Syntax :- syntex refers to the set of rules that defines the structure of language 
EX:- 
print(10+20)
print("Hello world")

# Identifies - simply call as name like class, variable, function name
EX:- 
name = "shivakumar"
class_flipkar = "flipkar"
def add_to_cout = "123asdfgh"

# variable decleration :- it is a container that will store the value
EX:- 
name = "ram"
age = 21

note:- it will store the data in PVM (Python virtual machine)
print(id(name)) # location check

# Rules of variable 
>>> We can use both lower and Upper-case value 
>>> We can use numeric link 0-9
>>> We can use underscore "-"
>>> We can use a variable starting with charecters.

EX:- 
Valid variable                    |       invalid variable 
name = "shiva"                    |  name_@ = "shiva"
Name = "shiva"                    |  First name = "shiva"
Username = "shiva"                |  123 Username = "shiva"
username_123 = "shiva"            |  123456 = "shiva"
_name = "shiva"                   |
__name = "shiv"                   |
